CLAM Webservices for Natural Language Processing
=====================================================

This is a collection of CLAM webservices (i.e. RESTful wesbervices powered by CLAM,
https://proycon.github.io/clam) for various Natural Language Processing
tools.  These webservices are hosted on https://webservices-lst.science.ru.nl .

CLAM webservices for the following tools are supplied here:

* `Frog <https://languagemachines.github.io/frog>`_
* `Ucto <https://languagemachines.github.io/ucto>`_
* `Timbl <https://languagemachines.github.io/timbl>`_
* `Colibri Core <https://proycon.github.io/colibri-core>`_
* `Alpino <http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/alp/Alpino/>`_

The tools themselves are not in this repository and need to be installed
separately, we recommend to use our `LaMachine <https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine>`_
distribution which contains everything at once.

To install these CLAM webservices manually, clone this repository and run:

``python setup.py install``
