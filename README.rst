A collection of CLAM webservices (powered using CLAM,
https://proycon.github.io/clam) for various of our Natural Language Processing
tools.  These webservices are hosted on https://webservices-lst.science.ru.nl .

CLAM webservices for the following tools are supplied here:

* `Frog <https://languagemachines.github.io/frog>`_ 
* `Ucto <https://languagemachines.github.io/ucto>`_ 
* `Timbl <https://languagemachines.github.io/timbl>`_ 
* `Colibri Core <https://proycon.github.io/colibri-core>`_ 

The tools themselves are not in this repository and need to be installed
separately, we recommend to use our `LaMachine <https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine>`_
distribution which contains everything at once.

To install these CLAM webservices manually, clone this repository and run:

``python setup.py install``
